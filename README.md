# pySCION
pySCION (python Spatial Continuous IntegratiON) is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It is a mixed dimensional system with a steady state 3D interpolated climate, 2D land surface and nondimensional ocean. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earthâ€™s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing. This version is written in python and ported from the Matlab version 1.1.6, where full model equations can be found (https://github.com/bjwmills/SCION).

SCION was originally written in MatLab by Ben Mills (Mills et al. 2021). pySCION was ported by Andrew Merdith (Merdith et al. 2025)

Requires python installation (originally built on 3.9, but seems to work on other versions) and (reasonably) standard python libraries.
